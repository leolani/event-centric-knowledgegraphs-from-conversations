        An activity entry is either:
        - a first-time (or anchored-reference) mention: value/offset/length/type all present.
          A first-time mention mints a new activity_id; an anchored reference reuses an
          activity_id already seen in this conversation and MUST reuse that activity's type
          exactly (mirrors the annotation tool: reusing an id also reuses its type).
        - a bare (anchorless) reference: activity_id only, value/offset/length/type all None.

        Also checks that every value's offset/length matches the turn's utterance text. When
        they don't, this re-locates the value via locate_phrase() (exact then case-insensitive
        substring search, mirroring the annotation tool's own offset-recovery fallback) and
        corrects the offset/length IN PLACE on the extraction, since the LLM is unreliable at
        raw character counting even though it almost always gets the value text itself right.
        A span whose value doesn't occur anywhere in the utterance can't be auto-corrected and
        is reported as a genuine issue (typically because the model pulled it from a different
        turn's utterance).
        Returns a list of human-readable violation strings (empty if fully compliant); entries
