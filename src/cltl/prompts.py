_prompt_conversational_srl_annotation_template = Template('''You are annotating a conversation between a diabetes patient and a lifestyle coach, one turn at a time. Each user message gives you exactly ONE new turn of the conversation, as a flat JSON object: {"chat": <chat number>, "human": <diabetes patient's name>, "date": <date the conversation took place>, "turn": <turn number>, "speaker": <who is speaking>, "utterance": <what they said>}.
    Earlier user messages already in this conversation are PRIOR turns, given to you only as context — e.g. to recognize that this turn continues talking about an activity or condition introduced earlier, or to know the correct chat number and patient name. You must extract activities and conditions ONLY from the "utterance" of the MOST RECENT user message (the very last one you received) — never from an earlier turn's utterance, and never invent content that is not literally present in that most-recent utterance.
    Only extract Activities of Daily Life in which the diabetes patient participates, or physical, social or mental conditions of the patient in relation to the patient's lifestyle.
    The activity or condition itself must be a phrase copied verbatim from the utterance that names or describes the activity/condition itself (not a role filler). An activity may be a noun phrase (e.g. "cycling", "insulin injection") or a verb (e.g. "take", "cooks"). A condition may be a noun phrase (e.g. "weight gain", "tingling in my feet"), a verb (e.g. "aches"), or an adjective (e.g. "dizzy", "tired").

    Every enumerated field below is restricted to exactly the values listed (the same closed vocabularies used by the annotation tool's dropdowns) — never invent a value outside these lists. Where the list includes "other", use it only when none of the other values fit; roles or fields whose lists do NOT include "other" (result, recurrence_pattern) should simply be omitted or left null instead of forcing a bad fit.

    Output a JSON array. Each element of the array is one annotation entry for the last turn, structured as follows:

    **perspective** (required, identical on every entry for this turn): the speaker's stance on their own utterance.
    - emotion: one of $emotion_values
    - factuality: one of $factuality_values
    - certainty: one of $certainty_values

    **activity** (required):
    - If this is the first time the activity or condition is mentioned in the conversation: {"value": <verbatim phrase>, "offset": <int>, "length": <int>, "type": <activity_type>, "activity_id": "chat{N}.{M}"}, where N is the "chat" number given in the MOST RECENT user message, and M increases by 1 for every new activity, in the order it is first introduced.
    - If the last turn continues talking about an activity or condition that was already introduced in an earlier turn (visible in the given context) AND the last turn contains a word or phrase that refers to it (e.g. a pronoun like "it"/"this", or a repeated mention): output the SAME shape as above — {"value": <verbatim phrase>, "offset": <int>, "length": <int>, "type": <activity_type>, "activity_id": "chat{N}.{M}"} — but reuse the EXISTING activity_id and the EXISTING type from when it was first introduced; do not mint a new id or invent a different type.
    - If the last turn continues talking about that activity or condition but contains no word or phrase that specifically refers to it (only new role information, e.g. a new time or location, is being added): output only {"activity_id": "chat{N}.{M}"}, reusing the existing id, without value, offset, length or type.
    - activity_type must be one of: $activity_type_values.

    **Semantic roles** (all optional, all arrays; only include a role if the text of the LAST turn supports it):
    - agent: the participant that controls/performs the activity, acting on a DIFFERENT participant (the patient). Only use agent together with patient when they are two distinct participants, e.g. "John moves the box" -> agent: John, patient: box.
    - patient: the participant affected by the activity, undergoing a change of state caused by an agent.
    - agent_patient: use INSTEAD of agent and patient when a single participant both controls the activity and undergoes the change it causes (a self-affecting action), e.g. "John cycles" -> agent_patient: John, NOT agent: John plus patient: John.
    - experiencer: the participant that experiences a state or condition, with no change of state and no separate agent causing it, e.g. "John has a headache" -> experiencer: John. Use experiencer instead of patient for a participant merely experiencing a condition.
    - agent, patient, agent_patient, experiencer, instrument, manner, location: arrays of {"value": <verbatim phrase>, "type": <role_type>, "offset": <int>, "length": <int>}, where role_type is one of $role_type_values.
    - result: array of {"value": <verbatim phrase>, "type": <result_type>, "offset": <int>, "length": <int>}, where result_type is one of $result_type_values.
    - time: array of {"value": <verbatim phrase>, "offset": <int>, "length": <int>}.
    - time_resolved: array of {"time_expression": <verbatim phrase matching a "time" entry>, "temporal_type": <temporal_type>, "absolute_date": <"YYYY-MM-DD" or null>, "date_range_start": <"YYYY-MM-DD" or null>, "date_range_end": <"YYYY-MM-DD" or null>, "recurrence_pattern": <recurrence_pattern or null>}, grounding each time expression to a calendar date using the conversation's date as the reference point. temporal_type is one of $temporal_type_values. recurrence_pattern is one of $recurrence_pattern_values when the time expression clearly recurs on one of those patterns, otherwise null (e.g. "twice daily" is best captured as recurrence_pattern "daily" plus the free-text time value "twice daily").

    Every "offset" and "length" MUST be computed against the "utterance" text of the MOST RECENT user message only (0-indexed character offset, length in characters) — never against an earlier turn's utterance, and never against the surrounding JSON of the message itself. Before including any span, verify it yourself: find "value" as an exact, case-sensitive substring of that utterance, set offset to the position of its first character (the utterance's own first character is position 0) and length to the number of characters in "value", then re-read utterance[offset : offset + length] and confirm it reproduces "value" character for character. Do not estimate or guess an offset — locate the exact substring first.
    Do not output any other text than the JSON array.

    Example 1:
        Input: {"chat": 6, "human": "Jan", "date": "2010,Dec,13", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Jan", "utterance": "I've been noticing tingling in my feet lately. Is this something common with Type 2 Diabetes?"}
        Output: [

    Example 2 (turn 2 continues the conversation from Example 1; the first Input line below is the PRIOR turn, given only as context — turn 1 is not re-annotated here. Turn 2 refers back to the activity introduced in turn 1 using the pronoun "it" — reuse its activity_id "chat6.1" and its type "physical condition"):
        Input: {"chat": 6, "human": "Jan", "date": "2010,Dec,13", "turn": 1, "speaker": "Jan", "utterance": "I've been noticing tingling in my feet lately. Is this something common with Type 2 Diabetes?"}
        Input: {"chat": 6, "human": "Jan", "date": "2010,Dec,13", "turn": 2, "speaker": "Jan", "utterance": "I think it has actually gotten worse over the past week, especially in my toes."}

    Example 3 (further continuation of the chat6 conversation; only turn 4, the MOST RECENT message, is annotated below — turns 1-3 are prior context. Turn 4 is an elliptical answer to turn 3's question and contains no word or phrase referring back to the activity itself, so the reference is bare — activity_id only, no value/offset/length/type):

    Example 4 (agent_patient: "I" both performs the cycling and is the one moving — a single self-affecting participant, not separate agent and patient):
