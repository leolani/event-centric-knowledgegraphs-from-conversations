But it's essential to listen to your body and adapt to your abilities. You mentioned that you have started walking more, which is excellent. You could also consider some light resistance training, such as using resistance bands or doing body-weight exercises like squats and lunges. These activities help build muscle, which can improve insulin sensitivity and enhance your ability to manage blood sugar levels."
